# Documentation

## Local Builds

- This is meant for testing locally, particularly if you do not have admin access on the [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/)

- Building: run `make html` while in this directory.

## Testing Changes

1) run `pip install restview`

2) run `restivew X.rst` which will render that file.


## Remote Builds

- Specifically for readthedocs, the system will automatically handle the builds for the `main` and `latest` branches. For anything else, reach
out to the admins for permissions.
